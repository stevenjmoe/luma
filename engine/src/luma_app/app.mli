val add_plugin : (t -> t) -> t -> t
(** [add_plugin plugin app] applies a plugin function to the application.

    A plugin is a function that takes an [App.t] and returns a modified [App.t]. Plugins are used to
    modularly set up initial state, register systems, add resources, spawn entities, or perform any
    other kind of app configuration before the main loop begins.

    Plugins can be composed freely and are applied in the order they are added.

    Example:
    {[
      let my_plugin app =
        let world = App.world app in
        let velocity = { x = 0.; y = 0. } in
        world
        |> World.add_entity
        |> World.with_component world (module Velocity.C) velocity
        |> ignore;
        app

      let () = App.create () |> App.add_plugin my_plugin |> App.run
    ]} *)

val run : (module Luma__driver.Driver.S) -> t -> unit

    the main game loop, and runs all [Update] systems. *)
